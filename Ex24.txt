/*

The interpolate method returns a function to be able to get any number between the values.
If the value put as input were 0.5 it would return the exact middle point between the two numbers:
[10.5, 26, 7].

However, in this case it returns numbers closer to the first set of numbers.
If we imagined a line between the numbers with a length of 1, this function returns the number at the position input in the method.
